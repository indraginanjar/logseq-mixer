# Logseq Composer ✍️

**Logseq Composer** is a plugin that connects your Logseq notes with any LLM using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).  
Hope you find it useful! 😀👍🍀🍷

### For the LLM to have access to your files you NEED TO RE-INDEX DB (bottom left green button). By default, only new or updated pages are indexed — this is fast even for large vaults.

### ⚙️ How It Works

- Uses [OpenAI embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) for semantic vector search
- Retrieves related notes using RAG (vector similarity search for now)
- Passes context into **any LLM** using [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm)
- Supports **all LiteLLM-compatible models**, including ChatGPT 4o, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, and local models via OLLAMA (with extra configuration)
- Plugin still runs without embeddings — the currently active note will be passed as fallback context

### ⚠️ Early Stage Notice

This is my **first Logseq plugin**, and it's still in **heavy development** with updates coming soon.

### 🛠 Plugin Settings (Detailed)

You can configure these in the Logseq plugin UI:

- **`selectedModel`**  
  - Example: `"gpt-4o"`  
  - The name of the LLM model to use. This is passed directly into LiteLLM, so it should match a valid model from the provider you're using.

- **`prompt`**  
  - This is the custom prompt shown to the LLM with every query.  
  - The word `"context"` inside your prompt is replaced by the text content pulled from your notes (via vector search or current page).  
  - Default is tuned for productivity, but you can customize it for different LLM personalities or task types.

- **`EmbeddingApiKey`**  
  - Used for generating vector embeddings of your notes (for semantic search).  
  - Currently only supports OpenAI’s `text-embedding-ada-002` model.  
  - If not set, vector search is skipped and only the current Logseq note is passed as context.  
  - You do **not** need this if you're okay with simpler functionality.

- **`LiteLLMLink`**   
  - The full endpoint to your LiteLLM instance.  
  - Default value:  
    ```
    http://172.105.80.74:4000/chat/completions
    ```
  - This is a public instance that forwards your request to the correct provider (OpenAI, Google, etc.) using your API key.  
  - You can self-host [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) for full control or privacy — just set your own URL here.

- **`apiKey`**  
  - The API key used to authenticate your request with the actual LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.).  
  - This key is passed to LiteLLM which handles routing and forwarding it properly.  
  - **Keep this secure**, especially if using shared or public LiteLLM endpoints.

- **`indexingMode`**  
  - Choose between `"incremental"` (default) and `"full"`.  
  - **Incremental**: Only embeds pages that are new or have been updated since the last index. Fast and cost-efficient.  
  - **Full**: Wipes the vector database and re-embeds every page from scratch. Use this if you suspect the index is corrupted or want a clean rebuild.
